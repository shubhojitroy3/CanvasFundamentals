# CanvasFundamentals

### Primary goal
Implementing Canvas fundamentals while learning. Also creating generic modules on the go 

### Secondary goal

### Languages/Tools/Frameworks
 - ES6/2015
 - Mocha + Chai + Karma
 - Visual Studio Code

I'm attempting to write components in a way that they are not dependent on third party libraries and frameworks as much as possible.
